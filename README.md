# Waste Classification using CNN Model

## In week-1..,

Firstly, the dataset was carefully prepared for training. Images were loaded dynamically from the given file paths, and OpenCV was used for reading and processing them into a consistent format. This ensured the data was clean and ready for use by the CNN model.

To improve the learning capability of the model, data augmentation techniques were applied. These techniques included operations like flipping, rotating, and zooming the images to create a more diverse training dataset. This helped the model generalize better to unseen data.

The training process was further optimized by including Batch Normalization layers in the CNN architecture. This helped stabilize the training and made it faster by normalizing the outputs of each layer.

Unnecessary warnings were suppressed in the code to make the output cleaner and more focused, allowing for better readability during development.

Lastly, the notebook incorporated a feature to visualize the CNN model architecture. This made it easier to understand and debug the model's structure.

These enhancements collectively improved the model's performance and usability, making it more robust for the task of waste classification.
